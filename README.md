## ABOUT

I am a quantitative and qualitative researcher and a PhD Candidate in Linguistics at Stony Brook University.

I received my Masters in TESOL from TeachersCollege, Columbia University and have taught English for more than nine years, in Japan, the US and Canada. I have also taught a Structure of English class to TESOL graduate students. 

My main interests in Linguistics are Phonology, Phonetics, Second Language Phonology/Prosody, Second Language Acquisition and Psycholinguistics.

My dissertation focuses to answer what factors affect L2 influence on L1 phonetic learning (Expected completion in August 2020).

I have also worked on information structure of Japanese ditransitives and how metathesis can be analyzed in Harmonic Serialism. 

I am currently involved in NSF funded interdisciplinary research project investigating International Teaching Assistants’ communication with native speakers.
