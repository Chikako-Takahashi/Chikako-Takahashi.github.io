## ABOUT

I am a quantitative and qualitative researcher and a PhD Candidate in Linguistics at Stony Brook University.

I received my Masters in TESOL from TeachersCollege, Columbia University and has recently received PhD in Linguistics from Stony Brook University.

My main interests in Linguistics are Phonetics, Phonology, Second Language Phonology/Prosody, Second Language Acquisition and Psycholinguistics. My dissertation focused on various factors that affect L2 influence on L1 phonetic learning.

Teaching is also my passion and have taught ESL/EFL, English for Academic Purposes, and various Linguistics courses in the past 10 years. In the Spring 2021 semester, I will be teaching Linguistics courses as well as Introductory Japanese at several institutions.
